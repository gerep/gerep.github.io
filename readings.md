I will keep track of my readings here:

**books**

* [Crer ou não crer](https://www.amazon.com.br/Crer-ou-n%C3%A3o-F%C3%A1bio-Melo/dp/8542211316/)
  * Great conversation between two incredible minds, respectful and smart disagreement
* [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com.br/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-English-ebook/dp/B07D23CFGR/)
  * More of the same, find the cue, work on that, too many pages to express some simple concepts
* [Filosofia](https://www.amazon.com.br/Tudo-precisa-saber-sobre-filosofia/dp/8573129727)
  * Good for those interested in knowing how some filosophies came to be.
* [The Courage to be Disliked](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274/)
  * This one is a gem, socratic to the most. Great insights.
* [The Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Philosophers-Guide-Life/dp/1545461112)
  * Got this book because I am interested in the Stoic filosophy, if you are not, I believe you can skip it.
* [Little Black Book Entrepreneurship Contrarians](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Black-Book-Entrepreneurship-Contrarians/dp/1480576883).
  * The kind of book I enjoy reading, giving examples from real life, to the point and great advices.
* [Homo Deus](https://www.amazon.com.br/Homo-deus-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/8535928197)
  * It is a continuation of Sapiens (also a great book). You will find history and future here.
* [Filho do Éden](https://www.amazon.com.br/Filhos-%C3%89den-Herdeiros-Atl%C3%A2ntida-Vol/dp/8576861410)
  * This is a fiction about angels and humans, not my kind of content but it was suggested by a friend.
* [Stillness is they key](https://www.amazon.com/Stillness-Key-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0525538585)
  * Vague suggestions on how to, maybe, become a better person, things like sleep more, be nice, avoid distraction and etc, too many pages to express simple things.

**everything else**

* [first principles](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)
