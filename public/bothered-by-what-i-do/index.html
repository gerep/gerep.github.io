    </header><p>It is frustrating to do something and not enjoy it.</p>
<p>I do not seek satisfaction in everything I do. Working with something that does not motivate, does not push you forward, that is a sad place to be.</p>
<p>Dealing with things that I do not like is required, that is what will make me grow. As I say, I do not have to leave my comfort zone, but I have to make it bigger. My comfort zone is where I shine.</p>
<p>The best way to increase my comfort zone is by doing something new or that I do not enjoy until I am good enough.</p>
<p>I believe that most of my frustration with what I do, software development, comes because I do not believe in 90% of what is done in technology.</p>
<p>Today, the process is not relevant anymore, only the results matter.</p>
<p>Looking for ways to accomplish the goal as fast as possible is causing the software development industry to become unbearable&hellip;</p>
<p>Uninteresting, tedious and good-for-nothing.</p>
<p>With my short experience, I learned that complaining does not change anything, it only exposes a view on something.</p>
<p>Maybe, the solution to this frustration is to have my own thing. To have my own business.</p>
<p>I know a company comes with a load of different problems, but I also know that, by owning it, I will be able to apply what I believe is now forgotten in software development.</p>
