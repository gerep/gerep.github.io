    </header><p>I am feeling anxious for a while and to find its cause was not obvious.</p>
<p>I work for a company that has a box where it tries to fit all its employees and I am terrible when someone tries to make fit somewhere I don&rsquo;t belong or have no interest in belonging to.</p>
<p>I found a tweet with the saying: &ldquo;Trying to fit in when you are fundamentally an outlier will make you anxious.&rdquo;, it clicked. My job is the root of this anxiety.</p>
<p>I shared that with some people and the suggestions were the same, &ldquo;try to fit in&rdquo;, &ldquo;put yourself in the boss&rsquo;s shoes&rdquo; etc. My interpretation is that they are already boxed in and are trying to lure me into it, not with bad intentions but because I am an outlier.</p>
<p>I know they are glad in the box, I will not be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fit it. I do not believe in the box, the reasons for it, the ways it chose to do things, the mentality it cultivates in its employees' mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fit and I won&rsquo;t fit, I am not content with that, I demur because it makes me anxious.</p>
