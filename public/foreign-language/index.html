    </header><p>My first language is Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>A friend of mine once said that, to him, Portuguese was noise. He was not criticizing the language. He had a good point.</p>
<p>Any other language not your own is noise in the beginning.</p>
<p>The way I speak Portuguese is different from the way I speak English or Spanish.</p>
<p>In Portuguese, I can be more emotional while explaining things or telling a story. I give words their necessary weight or find better ones. It makes all the difference in a conversation.</p>
<p>When I speak in English, there is a lack of vocabulary. All sounds superficial and maybe silly, without any deep meaning.</p>
<p>It is like a person that doesn&rsquo;t know how to tell a good joke.</p>
<p>It is complicated to express any experience or share a feeling in a language that is not yours.</p>
<p>Maybe we need a better vocabulary to become more natural.</p>
<p>Also, emotionally connected to the language.</p>
<p>Maybe I should read more non-tech content, more poetry?</p>
