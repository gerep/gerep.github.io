    </header><p>Time is a non-renewable resource. We may spend it as if it is renewable, which is a mistake.</p>
<p>We need to make some tough choices and spend our precious time doing things we don&rsquo;t enjoy but have to.</p>
<p>When thinking about improving ourselves, we think about the time required.</p>
<p>A friend of mine once asked me: &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s worth taking a 4-year course? I am already 36!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My answer was something like this:</p>
<p>I am also 36, and if we live to double that, we will be 72!</p>
<p>So, if you take the course, you will be 40 and with a degree.</p>
<p>If you do not take the course, you will still be 40 but with no degree.</p>
<p>The 40s will come, no matter what.</p>
<p>So, spending some time to improve ourselves, even if it takes another 36 years, will be worth it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to stall.</p>
<p>We are alive.</p>
<p>Act like so!</p>
