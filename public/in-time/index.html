    </header><p>There is a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ022pvlKOk">In Time</a> by Danny Elfman that has small but powerful lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In time we all create ourselves<br>
In time we make our own dominion<br>
We make our homes we make our hell<br>
We make our paradise as well<br></p>
<p>Our lives, our tribes, our own religion<br>
We build ourselves a grand illusion<br>
Design our minds to find inclusion<br></p>
<p>In time it all falls down<br>
Explodes without a sound<br>
Like stars colliding deep in space<br></p>
<p>In time<br>
In time<br>
In time<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding of it goes like this.</p>
<p>The first part suggests the idea that humans create themselves and civilizations. With that, we also create problems we didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>The second part shares an idea that I also believe is true. Most, if not all we do, is a grand illusion. We create myths about what we don&rsquo;t understand and don&rsquo;t have an explanation. We see part of the world today divided by that confusion.</p>
<p>For the last part, we will eventually collapse. Probably by our own hands,  economic or societal collapse.</p>
<p>Although it sounds depressive, I see it as the truth. It should not bring us down. It should be a warning about how we are living our lives.</p>
<p>It should be a reminder that we must take advantage of now, the only thing we truly have.</p>
<p>Enjoy your friends and family.</p>
<p>Avoid going down the same old road that made you sad.</p>
<p>Create new memories, new regrets, new hopes.</p>
<p>All we need is a modest life.</p>
