    </header><p>I enjoy spending some time alone, doing nothing, just observing my thoughts and criticizing them.</p>
<p>I started to think about ownership and began to disapprove this idea and wanted to know why.</p>
<p>To my surprise, what came to mind was some of my close friend&rsquo;s opinions, not mine. It was a sad moment, realizing I was carrying an idea that was not mine.</p>
<p>The next day, I woke up with a mission, understand ownership and why some companies have that at their core.</p>
<p>I talked to my boss, also a good friend and shared my view on the subject. Another sad moment when I noticed that everything I said was not good, pouring negativity in my words about something I didn&rsquo;t know well.</p>
<p>Thinking about ownership, now by myself, I concluded that it is not a bad thing, it may be miss interpreted.</p>
<p>When a company says that an employee should act with ownership, it is not like owning a house or a company. It is more about owning what you do, say and think.</p>
<p>I noticed I didn&rsquo;t own my opinion about ownership.</p>
<p>Now I own it. Thanks to quiet moments where I can analyze my thoughts and criticize them.</p>
<p>With that, I learned two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>ownership is not a bad thing that companies are asking for;</li>
<li>I should be careful about what my mind is absorbing from those around me.
Now I am aware that some of my opinions, thoughts and what I say are not entirely me.</li>
</ul>
<p>How much of me is genuine? I believe there is no way to estimate that,  maybe nobody is 100% original. We are always carrying something from those around us and our environment.</p>
<p>Even when I am not 100% myself, I should still own what I am.</p>
