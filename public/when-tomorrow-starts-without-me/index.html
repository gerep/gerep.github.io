<p>When tomorrow starts without me,<br/>
And I&rsquo;m not there to see,<br/>
If the sun should rise and find your eyes<br/>
all filled with tears for me,<br/></p>
<p>I wish so much you wouldn&rsquo;t cry<br/>
The way you did today,<br/>
While thinking of the many things,<br/>
We didn&rsquo;t get to say.<br/></p>
<p>I know how much you love me,<br/>
As much as I love you,<br/>
and each time that you think of me,<br/>
I know you&rsquo;ll miss me too.<br/></p>
<p>But when tomorrow starts without me,<br/>
Please try to understand,<br/>
That an angel came and called my name,<br/>
And took me by the hand,<br/>
and said my place was ready,<br/>
In heaven far above,<br/>
And that I&rsquo;d have to leave behind<br/>
All those I dearly love.<br/></p>
<p>But as I turned to walk away,<br/>
A tear fell from my eye<br/>
For all my life, I&rsquo;d always thought,<br/>
I didn&rsquo;t want to die.<br/></p>
<p>I had so much to live for,<br/>
So much left yet to do,<br/>
It seemed almost impossible,<br/>
That I was leaving you.<br/></p>
<p>I thought of all the yesterdays<br/>
The good ones and the bad,<br/>
I thought of all the love we shared,<br/>
and all the fun we had<br/></p>
<p>If I could re-live yesterday<br/>
Just even for a while,<br/>
I&rsquo;d say good-bye and kiss you<br/>
And maybe see you smile.<br/></p>
<p>But then I fully realized,<br/>
That this could never be,<br/>
For emptiness and memories,<br/>
would take the place of me.<br/></p>
<p>And when I thought of worldly things,<br/>
I might miss come tomorrow,<br/>
I thought of you, and when I did,<br/>
My heart was filled with sorrow.<br/></p>
<p>But when I walked through heaven&rsquo;s gates,<br/>
I felt so much at home<br/>
When God looked down and smiled at me,<br/>
From His great golden throne.<br/></p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;This is eternity,<br/>
And all I&rsquo;ve promised you.&quot;<br/>
Today your life on earth is past,<br/>
But here life starts anew<br/></p>
<p>I promise no tomorrow,<br/>
But today will always last,<br/>
And since each day&rsquo;s the same way<br/>
There&rsquo;s no longing for the past.<br/></p>
<p>You have been so faithful,<br/>
So trusting and so true.<br/>
Though there were times<br/>
You did some things<br/>
You knew you shouldn&rsquo;t do.<br/></p>
<p>But you have been forgiven<br/>
And now at last you&rsquo;re free.<br/>
So won&rsquo;t you come and take my hand<br/>
And share my life with me?<br/></p>
<p>So when tomorrow starts without me,<br/>
Don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re far apart,<br/>
For every time you think of me,<br/>
I&rsquo;m right here, in your heart.<br/></p>
