    </header><p>Yes, I am swimming against the tide here.</p>
<p>I have spent hours and days reading books and articles about how to do this or that better.</p>
<p>When I wanted to take notes, I would search &ldquo;how to take notes&rdquo;. There is a lot of content we can read about that. There are techniques, best practices and tools. After hours of reading, testing apps and watching YouTube videos, there is only one thing I did not do, take notes.</p>
<p>When I wanted to make the most of the books, I would search for &ldquo;how to read a book&rdquo;. After some time, guess what? I didn&rsquo;t read the book.</p>
<p>I am interested in languages. Every time Spotify started playing music in a different language, I would look for the lyrics. That would trigger me to the point of &ldquo;I need to learn that language&rdquo;, and I would spend time searching for courses, videos and apps that could teach me how to speak in that language.</p>
<p>I like being alone with my thoughts. I take advantage of that time, and instead of using my phone, I sit and let my mind drift.</p>
<p>In one of those moments, these ideas emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I trying to improve?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why do I want to rush things?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why do I want to learn a new language?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why do I want to read a book a month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The short answer is ego.</p>
<p>I wanted to say: I speak a new language or read this many books or can take notes like a pro</p>
<p>What they have in common is that none of those &ldquo;justifications&rdquo; was towards me! I wanted to be good for others.</p>
<p>I wanted to improve so I could impress others.</p>
<p>It could not get more stupid!</p>
<p>So, what did I do? I started doing, stopped asking or looking for suggestions, techniques, tricks, apps, courses, etc.</p>
<p>I sit and read the book I want to read.
I grab a pen and write down what I think is relevant.</p>
<p>This need to impress, to show how I am interesting, pretty, informed, whatever is dead!</p>
