    </header><p>I see myself, with frequency, in a place where I am not. By that, I mean the past and the future.</p>
<p>I am living in the wrong place. The right place? The present.</p>
<p>Trying to understand why, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about life being a journey, something to go through.</p>
<p>To me, that is not correct because it is forcing me to live where I am not.</p>
<p>Maybe life is not a journey but something to let happen.</p>
<p>It looks like we are always trying to do the right thing that will give us peace of mind, bring happiness.</p>
<p>Lasting happiness is something that we achieve, is the result of something we do.</p>
<p>The future looks like the same thing. It is not something we have but something we look for and work to achieve.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have the future? Because we don&rsquo;t know when it is going to end.</p>
<p>Time is the only resource we are sure is not renewable, and we spend it as if it were.</p>
<p>We only need two things to be able to achieve the future we want.</p>
<p>Time and the present.</p>
<p>Our life is simple competition and cooperation. We may start different, but we all end the same.</p>
<p>A piece of advice to myself: stop living where I am not.</p>
