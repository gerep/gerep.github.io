The idea is simple.

You need to keep switching between your terminal and browser to check the repository (git/bitbucket/gitlab) you are working on and that's why I have decided to automate that process.

Inside a git project, type:


```
git open
```
      
Your default browser will open in the actual branch but you can specify one.


```
git open neocities
```
      
That's it!
