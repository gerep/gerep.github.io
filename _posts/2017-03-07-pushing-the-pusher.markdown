My personality type is ENTP, also known as “The debater” so you might wonder how it is to live with a debater.

> “Taking a certain pleasure in being the underdog, ENTPs enjoy the mental exercise found in questioning the prevailing mode of thought, making them irreplaceable in reworking existing systems or shaking things up and pushing them in clever new directions. However, they’ll be miserable managing the day-to-day mechanics of actually implementing their suggestions.”

I am also looking for new things to learn, replace, discuss, test and intrigue myself, believing that first principles are a must.

When I push someone, I am not trying to be a mean person. I keep asking “why” until they break, trying to help them understand the “whys” of their faith, opinion and ideas.

That sounds like a mean thing to do, although it is not for me and I have noticed that some people feel bad because of it.

To believe in something because my parents told me so, to use something because someone said so, to eat something because it appeared on a TV commercial, all that sounds impossible to me.

I want to know why I have faith in god A or none, why I use Go instead of Ruby (programming languages), why I should not eat a lot of sugar.

To me, all that sounds beautiful and inspiring but not for everybody.

That is why I have decided to push myself only.

Push the pusher and see how it works.
