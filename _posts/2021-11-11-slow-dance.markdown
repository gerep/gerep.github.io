## Slow Dance

<br/>

_Have you ever watched kids_

_On a merry-go-round?_

<br/>

_Or listened to the rain_

_Slapping on the ground?_

<br/>

_Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?_

_Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?_

<br/>

_You better slow down._

_Don't dance so fast._

<br/>

_Time is short._

_The music won't last._

<br/>

_Do you through each day_

_On the fly?_

<br/>

_When you ask: How are you?_

_Do you the reply?_

<br/>

_When the day is done,_

_do you lie in your bed_

<br/>

_With the next hundred chores_

_Running through your head?_

<br/>

_You'd better slow down._

_Don't dance so fast._

<br/>

_Time is short._

_The music won't last._

<br/>

_Ever told your child,_

_We'll do it tomorrow?_

<br/>

_And in your hast,_

_Not see his sorrow?_

<br/>

_Ever lost touch._

_Let a good friendship die_

<br/>

_Cause you never had time_

_To call and say, "Hi"?_

<br/>

_You'd better slow down._

_Don't dance so fast._

<br/>

_Time is short._

_The music won't last._

<br/>

_When you run so fast to get somewhere_

_You miss half the fun of getting there._

<br/>

_When you worry and hurry through your day,_

_It is like an unopened gift thrown away._

<br/>

_Life is not a race._

_Do take it slower._

<br/>

_Hear the music._

_Before the song is over._
