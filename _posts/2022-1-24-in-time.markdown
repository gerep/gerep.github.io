There is a song called [In Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ022pvlKOk) by Danny Elfman that has small but powerful lyrics.

> In time we all create ourselves<br>
> In time we make our own dominion<br>
> We make our homes we make our hell<br>
> We make our paradise as well<br>
>
> Our lives, our tribes, our own religion<br>
> We build ourselves a grand illusion<br>
> Design our minds to find inclusion<br>
>
> In time it all falls down<br> 
> Explodes without a sound<br>
> Like stars colliding deep in space<br>
> 
> In time<br>
> In time<br>
> In time<br>

My understanding of it goes like this.

The first part suggests the idea that humans create themselves and civilizations. With that, we also create problems we didn't have before.

The second part shares an idea that I also believe is true. Most, if not all we do, is a grand illusion. We create myths about what we don't understand and don't have an explanation. We see part of the world today divided by that confusion.

For the last part, we will eventually collapse. Probably by our own hands,  economic or societal collapse.

Although it sounds depressive, I see it as the truth. It should not bring us down. It should be a warning about how we are living our lives.



It should be a reminder that we must take advantage of now, the only thing we truly have.

Enjoy your friends and family.

Avoid going down the same old road that made you sad.

Create new memories, new regrets, new hopes.

All we need is a modest life.
