(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about))

Playing computer games only during weekends. I can do a better use of my time doing something else, like reading.

Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

Spending a lot more time with my wife and two kids.

I had to pause my readings because I am taking the course [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com).
