(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about))

Playing computer games only during weekends. I can do a better use of my time doing something else, like reading.

Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

Spending a lot more time with my wife and two kids.

I have started the course [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and I noticed that I need some background in mathematics, review some concepts and then go back to this course.
I am currently taking the [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/) source and it is being helpful and fun to review some topics and some topics from the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course are clearer now.

I have noticed that I am getting bored easily and simple things are getting my attention as easily as well. This attempt to look for simplicity is also being applied to my reading, some books are unnecessarily big, too many pages to explain simple concepts, too many pages to say more of the same, just boring =)
