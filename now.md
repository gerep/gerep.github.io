Not playing on my computer anymore =)

Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

I have finished the course [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/) and it was reaççy helpful but it demands practice, like everything else. With that, I can restart the course [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Small talk easily bores me the way it never did, which is a good thing.

Trying to help my oldest son to understand his feelings, why and how they come to be, the way we react to situations outside of our control. Basicaly, the Stoic way of seing the world.
