Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

I am writing down anything interesting that comes to my mind in Evernote. Currently I am trying to understand the meaning of many things we humans do, things related to decision making, ego, meaning of work and sacrifice and family. Time is of essence so we need to know what we do and why (so far that is what I believe)

I have started creating a game using Unity as a way of distracting myself from playing Dota. It turns out I am enjoying every bit of the process. I consider it a success because my free time is now spent with something productive =)
