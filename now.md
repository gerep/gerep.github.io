(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about))

Playing computer games only during weekends. I can do a better use of my time doing something else, like reading.

Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

Spending a lot more time with my wife and two kids.

I have finished an introductory course in AI, [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com) and I recommend if you have interest in that subject. Currently taking the course [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and I am having a hard time to understand the math behind the algorithm. To help me with that I have created an account on [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) and I am studying mathematics.
