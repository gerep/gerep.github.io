I am back to playing but with moderation, there is the right time and I think I have found it.

Still answering "no" to focus on what is significant.

Practioner of the Stoic philosophy.

Gave up on all the AI stuff. I believe it is still the future but I need to focus on something else that will help me start my own business instead of just studying non-stop.

I am writing down anything that comes to my mind in a small notebook. Evernote is being usefull but I need to improve my note taking habilities.
