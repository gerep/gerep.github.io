(in progress)

This is my first game.

I'm using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 4.

It is a single-player, top-down 2D shooter.

This game tells the story of a soul in hell, Koyma.

Koyma was allowed to leave hell by going through a series of challenges.

Each level will have a distinct difficulty, represented by a sin or bad human behaviour, such as anger, anxiety, fear, or greed.

The game will also use music to set the mood.

My main intention is not to create a bullet-hell game or make it take hours. I always liked playing games that made me feel something, and this is my main objective with this game.

Who knows if this will become what I think it will. If that happens, I may make game development my new career.

I have [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), which is an easy tool for creating 2D art. However, although I tried creating assets for this game, I'm not an artist.

For now, everything will be geometric 2D shapes. In the future, I will add animation, particles, and lighting.
