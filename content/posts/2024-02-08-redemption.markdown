(in progress)

This is my first game.

I'm using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 3.5.

It is a single-player, top-down 2D shooter.

This game tells the story of a soul in hell, Koyma.

Koyma was allowed to leave hell by going through a series of challenges.

Each level will have a distinct difficulty, represented by a sin or bad human behaviour like anger, anxiety, fear, greed, etc.

The game will also use music to set the mood.

My main intention is not to create a bullet-hell game or for it to take hours. I always liked playing games that made me feel something. This is my main objective with this game.

Who knows if this is going to become what I think it will. If that happens, I may make game development my new career.

I have [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), and it's an easy tool to use and create 2D art. The problem is I'm not an artist, although I tried creating assets for this game.

For now, everything will be geometric 2D shapes. I will add animation, particles and lighting in the future.
