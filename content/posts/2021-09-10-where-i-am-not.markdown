I see myself, with frequency, in a place where I am not. By that, I mean the past and the future.

I am living in the wrong place. The right place? The present.

Trying to understand why, I can't stop thinking about life being a journey, something to go through.

To me, that is not correct because it is forcing me to live where I am not. 

Maybe life is not a journey but something to let happen. 

It looks like we are always trying to do the right thing that will give us peace of mind, bring happiness.

Lasting happiness is something that we achieve, is the result of something we do.

The future looks like the same thing. It is not something we have but something we look for and work to achieve.

Why don't we have the future? Because we don't know when it is going to end.

Time is the only resource we are sure is not renewable, and we spend it as if it were.

We only need two things to be able to achieve the future we want.

Time and the present.

Our life is simple competition and cooperation. We may start different, but we all end the same.

A piece of advice to myself: stop living where I am not.
