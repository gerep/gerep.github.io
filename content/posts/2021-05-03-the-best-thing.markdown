One day my son asked me: "Dad, to you, what is the best thing to do?" 

Since it is a complex question, I asked him for some time to think. 

After a few days, going to take a shower, I remember how good it felt when the warm water touched my skin and that was it.

"Son, I believe I have an answer."

The first moment of anything you want to do.

- The first sip of water when you are thirsty.
- The first jump in a pool on a hot day.
- The first bite when you are hungry.
- The moment you lay down on your bed/couch after a long day.
- ...

Enjoy those first moments.
