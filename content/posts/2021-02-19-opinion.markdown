It is required to test my opinions, to validate them willingly.

Making my opinions stronger or abandoning the wrong ones, will make me a stronger person.

I am training myself to get stronger when in disagreement. To have a clear mind, without judgement and simply listen.

I don't want to be that person that gets annoyed when someone challenges me with "why" questions. If I don't know the answer, I have a problem to fix.

Every wrong opinion deserves criticism.
