My first language is Brazilian Portuguese.

A friend of mine once said that, to him, Portuguese was noise. He was not criticizing the language. He had a good point.

Any other language not your own is noise in the beginning.

The way I speak Portuguese is different from the way I speak English or Spanish.

In Portuguese, I can be more emotional while explaining things or telling a story. I give words their necessary weight or find better ones. It makes all the difference in a conversation.

When I speak in English, there is a lack of vocabulary. All sounds superficial and maybe silly, without any deep meaning.

It is like a person that doesn't know how to tell a good joke.

It is complicated to express any experience or share a feeling in a language that is not yours.

Maybe we need a better vocabulary to become more natural.

Also, emotionally connected to the language.

Maybe I should read more non-tech content, more poetry?
