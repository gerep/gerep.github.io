Time is a non-renewable resource. We may spend it as if it is renewable, which is a mistake.

We need to make some tough choices and spend our precious time doing things we don't enjoy but have to.

When thinking about improving ourselves, we think about the time required.

A friend of mine once asked me: "Do you think it's worth taking a 4-year course? I am already 36!"

My answer was something like this:

I am also 36, and if we live to double that, we will be 72!

So, if you take the course, you will be 40 and with a degree.

If you do not take the course, you will still be 40 but with no degree.

The 40s will come, no matter what.

So, spending some time to improve ourselves, even if it takes another 36 years, will be worth it.

We don't have to stall.

We are alive.

Act like so!
