On this glorious day, a being from other parts of the galaxy left me here on Earth and said:

This is the day your existence decided to exist. Today. Go for it!

I quickly asked.

Does it make sense? No.

But does it have to? Neither.

Then what? Then nothing, nothing before and nothing after, only 'during', the best part.

And how do you use it? You have a random amount of time, the most valuable thing in the universe.

Time? Yes, a sequence of 'nows'. The now that has already been is the past, and what is not yet is called the future.

What? The past is a reference and not a rule. The future is anxiety. We only exist in the now.

He disappeared, and I'm still confused, but I'm alive in the 'now'. It's working!
