> When tomorrow starts without me,<br/>

> I wish so much you wouldn't cry<br/>
> The way you did today,<br/>
> While thinking of the many things,<br/>
> We didn't get to say.<br/>

> I know how much you love me,<br/>
> As much as I love you,<br/>

> I know you'll miss me too.<br/>

> But when tomorrow starts without me,<br/>
> Please try to understand,<br/>
> That an angel came and called my name,<br/>
> And took me by the hand,<br/>

> In heaven far above,<br/>
> And that I'd have to leave behind<br/>
> All those I dearly love.<br/>
>
> But as I turned to walk away,<br/>
> A tear fell from my eye<br/>
> For all my life, I'd always thought,<br/>
> I didn't want to die.<br/>
>
> I had so much to live for,<br/>
> So much left yet to do,<br/>
> It seemed almost impossible,<br/>
> That I was leaving you.<br/>
>
> I thought of all the yesterdays<br/>
> The good ones and the bad,<br/>
> I thought of all the love we shared,<br/>
> and all the fun we had<br/>
>
> If I could re-live yesterday<br/>
> Just even for a while,<br/>
> I'd say good-bye and kiss you<br/>
> And maybe see you smile.<br/>
>
> But then I fully realized,<br/>
> That this could never be,<br/>
> For emptiness and memories,<br/>
> would take the place of me.<br/>
>
> And when I thought of worldly things,<br/>
> I might miss come tomorrow,<br/>
> I thought of you, and when I did,<br/>
> My heart was filled with sorrow.<br/>
>
> But when I walked through heaven's gates,<br/>
> I felt so much at home<br/>
> When God looked down and smiled at me,<br/>
> From His great golden throne.<br/>
>
> He said, "This is eternity,<br/>
> And all I've promised you."<br/>
> Today your life on earth is past,<br/>
> But here life starts anew<br/>
>
> I promise no tomorrow,<br/>
> But today will always last,<br/>
> And since each day's the same way<br/>
> There's no longing for the past.<br/>
>
> You have been so faithful,<br/>
> So trusting and so true.<br/>
> Though there were times<br/>
> You did some things<br/>
> You knew you shouldn't do.<br/>
>
> But you have been forgiven<br/>
> And now at last you're free.<br/>
> So won't you come and take my hand<br/>
> And share my life with me?<br/>
>
> So when tomorrow starts without me,<br/>
> Don't think we're far apart,<br/>
> For every time you think of me,<br/>
> I'm right here, in your heart.<br/>
