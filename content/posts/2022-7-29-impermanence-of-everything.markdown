I've been thinking a lot about how everything is impermanent.

Everything alive will die.

The mountains will erode.

Soon everything that is will cease to be.

Being aware of this impermanence brings a gentle sadness.

It is the reality of life.

I feel this gentle sadness.

It makes everything worth noticing.

The beauty of a tree.

The wind on our skin.

The warmth from our star.

The bird song.

Walk barefoot on the grass.

The rain sound.

The taste of food.

The hug.

The laughter.

The tears.

People around us live their lives.

We will experience things for the first time.

We will experience things for the last time.

Sink inside yourself. Enjoy your impermanence.

We only have the current moment with one another.

Don't be afraid to forget.
