tar is not a compression tool, it simply creates and archive

Creating an archive:


```
tar -cf archive.tar file.txt
```
      
It will create the archive.tar with file.txt inside it. The extension is not mandatory but it is a good to differenciate an archive from other files and directories

Using verbose is a good option specially if dealing with big files since it will show errors or permission problems: -v.

Extracting from an archive.


```
tar -xvf archive.tar
```
     
Compression.

There are 3 compression types:

* gzip (-z)
* bzip2 (-j)
* compress (-Z)

```
tar -cvjf archive.tar.bz2 file.txt
```

The extensions here are also not mandatory but are importante because they indentify the compression used in the archive.
To extract, inform the compression used.

```
tar -xvjf archive.tar.bz2
```
      
To add to an archive.tar (not compressed), use the option: -r


```
tar -rvf archive.tar file2.txt
```
      
Listing (not compressed) -t


```
tar -tf archive.tar
```
      
Removing (not compressed) –delete


```
tar -f archive.tar –delete file.txt
```
      
Another important option: -C


```
tar -C /usr/local/ -xjvf archive.tar.bz2
```
      
Will extract the contents from archive.tar.bz2 into /usr/local/
